# This is the data for my blog
It is automatically transformed by Jekyll into a static site whenever I push this repository to GitHub.

# Running Jekyll
* Run `bundle exec jekyll serve`
* Your site should be available at http://localhost:4000

Find out about installing Jekyll, keeping it updated (with GitHub Pages), configuration settings, e.t.c. [here](https://help.github.com/articles/using-jekyll-with-pages/).

# Turning Jekyll off
You can completely opt out of Jekyll processing by creating a file named .nojekyll in the root of your Page repository and pushing that file to GitHub. This should only be necessary if your site uses directories that begin with an underscore, as Jekyll sees these as special directories and does not copy them to the final destination.
