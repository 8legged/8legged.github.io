Jekyll requires that Markdown files have front-matter defined at the top of every file. Front-matter is just a set of metadata, delineated by three dashes:

---
title: This is my title
layout: post
---

Here is my page.
If you like, you can choose to omit front-matter from your file, but you'll still need to make the triple-dashes:

---
---

Here is my page.
If your file is within the _posts directory, you can omit the dashes entirely.
