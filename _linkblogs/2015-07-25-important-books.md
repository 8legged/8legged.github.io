##### The Harvard Classics
The Harvard Classics, originally known as Dr. Eliot's Five Foot Shelf is a 51
volume series that you can download for free by going to these [Project Gutenberg](http://www.gutenberg.org/wiki/Harvard_Classics_(Bookshelf))
or [Internet Archive](http://www.archive.org/details/harvardclassics) pages.

[Open Culture says](http://www.openculture.com/2011/07/the_harvard_classics_a_free_digital_collection.html):

*"Charles W. Eliot made a frequent assertion: If you were to spend just 15
minutes a day reading the right
books, a quantity that could fit on a five foot shelf, you could give yourself a
proper liberal education. The publisher P. F. Collier and Son loved the idea and
asked Eliot to assemble the right collection of works. The result wasa 51-volume
series published in 1909 called Dr. Eliot’s Five Foot Shelf. Later it would
simply be called The Harvard Classics."*
