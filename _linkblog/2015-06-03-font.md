#### Basic Methods

* **Provide different font sizes for different reading distances**, currently
  achievable by detecting a device’s form factor using @media queries. Long
  term, this is probably not ideal — that is, until reading distance-detection
  techniques become more feasible. In the meantime, use Size Calculator by
  Nick Sherman and Chris Lewis to calculate the physical or perceived font size
  when factoring in reading distance.

* **Maintain perfect proportions in a paragraph** with letter spacing, word
  spacing and line height properties for each breakpoint. Universal Typography’s
  demo by Tim Brown of Nice Web Type is a very useful tool that can help you
  experiment with and adjust your paragraph proportions accordingly.

* **Establish hierarchy** using either a typographic scale (Modular Scale is a
  useful tool by Tim Brown and Scott Kellum) or different styles at the same
  font size — for instance, uppercase for h2, small caps for h3 and italics for
  h4 subheads. For more options and ideas on styling subheads, may I suggest you
  read “Setting Subheads With CSS” and explore examples of subheads set with CSS.

* For small screens, **indent paragraphs and separate page sections** with white
  space. For large screens, use block paragraphs and separate page sections with
  graphical elements (lines, shapes, color).

* **Use graded fonts** to normalize rendering across different pixel densities.
  Font grades are very subtle font weights used to compensate for different ink
  and paper qualities, as well as for different pixel densities on screen. This
  method is explained in detail in iA’s article “New Site With Responsive
  Typography.” In short, lighter grades are used for low-DPI screens and heavier
  grades for high-DPI screens, while graded fonts will also compensate for
  different sub-pixels’ direction between portrait and landscape mode on mobile
  and tablet devices.

* **Look for type families that have multiple optical sizes**, and use
  appropriate styles for body copy, tiny text and display sizes. For instance,
  Font Bureau, the company behind the Benton Modern family, makes many families
  like this with a wide stylistic palette.

* **Use different font widths** according to the width of the screen (see what
  happens with the subheads on the Benton website when you resize the browser
  window). For instance, use a condensed font for small screens and a wider
  font for larger desktop screens, just like on the brochure website for Input
  (again, resize the window). In the case of the Benton project, we set
  different font widths manually for each breakpoint, but there’s also a
  solution for automatic swapping using Font-To-Width (by Sherman and Lewis)
  that takes advantage of multiple-width type families to fit pieces of text
  snugly within their containers.
