I really like the way [Arvind Ravulavaru](http://thejackalofjavascript.com/portfolio/#/about)'s blog looks.
Also, his [JavaScript 101](http://thejackalofjavascript.com/javascript-101/)
post is a great learning resource. His [portfolio](http://thejackalofjavascript.com/portfolio/#/portfolio)
page is also pretty nice.

This is a summary of Arvind's JavaScript 101 guide - see the blog for the whole
post.

# Javascript 101

### Javascript Essentials
Javascript was introduced to make the webpages dynamic. Before Javascript it was
all Java Applets. So [Brenden Eich](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brendan_Eich),
the father of [Javascript](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript) built this
language in [10 days](http://www.computer.org/csdl/mags/co/2012/02/mco2012020007-abs.html)
, back in 1995. How it all began: [The Early Years](https://www.youtube.com/embed/JxAXlJEmNMg).

Here he is again discussing the History and basics of Javascript programming
language: [Douglas Crockford: The JavaScript Programming Language](https://www.youtube.com/embed/v2ifWcnQs6M)

And once more: [And Then There Was JavaScript](https://www.youtube.com/embed/RO1Wnu-xKoY)

Now that you've learned about the language and its origins, work through
[A re-introduction to JavaScript (JS tutorial)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/A_re-introduction_to_JavaScript)
via [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/).

Watch Douglas Crockford on [An Inconvenient API - The Theory of the DOM](https://www.youtube.com/embed/Y2Y0U-2qJMs).

Next, go through [Eloquent JavaScript](http://eloquentjavascript.net/)'s [The Document Object Model](http://eloquentjavascript.net/13_dom.html).
Then [Handling Events](http://eloquentjavascript.net/14_event.html). For a
better understanding of these concepts, there's [Event bubbling and Capturing](https://www.youtube.com/embed/0sfPDJiMTXk).

Now that you know what DOM manipulation is, what events are, and why they're
needed, it's time for Asynchronous Javascript and XML. **AJAX** is a way to
communicate with a server without refreshing an entire page. See [Crockford on JavaScript - Episode IV: The Metamorphosis of Ajax](https://www.youtube.com/embed/Fv9qT9joc0M).

We've now covered the basics of native Javascript, for the most part.

jQuery can be as essential as Javascript when working with the web. jQuery is a
simple wrapper around native Javascript methods that makes coding for the web
easier. With very little code you can achieve a lot. Watch the [jQuery Tutorial #1 - jQuery Tutorial for Beginners](https://www.youtube.com/embed/hMxGhHNOkCU?list=PLoYCgNOIyGABdI2V8I_SWo22tFpgh2s6_)
video series.

### Advanced Javascript
With a decent understanding of what Javascript is and where it fits, move on to
Douglas Crockford's video on [Advanced Javascript](https://www.youtube.com/embed/DwYPG6vreJg).

You'll find many more Crockford video links in this Stack Overflow post on the [best resources to learn JavaScript](http://stackoverflow.com/a/1531738/1015046).

Next, an [Introduction to Object-Oriented JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Introduction_to_Object-Oriented_JavaScript)
from MDN. Then [Inheritance and the prototype chain](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Inheritance_and_the_prototype_chain).
Now go through the quirkier parts of the JavaScript programming language over at
[JavaScript Garden](http://bonsaiden.github.io/JavaScript-Garden/).

For more quirks, head to [wtfjs](http://wtfjs.com/).

One cannot master Javascript with out going through [Addy Osmani](http://addyosmani.com/)'s
[Learning JavaScript Design Patterns](http://addyosmani.com/resources/essentialjsdesignpatterns/book/).

Also checkout [Xah Code](http://xahlee.info/) for [JavaScript Tutorial: Understand JavaScript in Depth](http://xahlee.info/js/js.html).

Check out Rebecca Murphy for [Writing Testable JavaScript](https://youtu.be/OzjogCFO4Zo).

Watch: [Quick and Easy JavaScript Testing](https://www.youtube.com/embed/6Odb1gwv7J0).

By now you may be seeing where frameworks like Backbone.js, Ember.js,
Angular.js, Closure library and so on fit when developing client-side applications.

### Javascript on Server
So far we have dealt with JavaScript on the client side. Now we'll look at
JavaScript on the server side.

An important difference between client-side and server-side JS is, the global
object. In the browser the global object is `window`. This should make sense
since we're  working inside a windowed environment. On the server it's the
operating system process. Also, server-side JS doesn't deal with the DOM or
HTML, or CSS for processing.

Server-side JavaScript started with Node.js. Node.js is powered by Google
Chrome's V8 engine.

If you're new to V8, [check out this video](https://www.youtube.com/embed/UJPdhx5zTaw).

Now for [An introductory video on Node.js](https://www.youtube.com/embed/jo_B4LTHi3I).
