### Foundational mistakes affect your ability to raise money
Since mistakes and bad habits formed early on can become costly savvy investors
(even in pre-seed rounds) will scrutinize not only your team, product, and
market, but also often-overlooked things like customer segments and funnel
metrics.

In order to get funded you'll need a validated hypothesis of who your customers
are and be able to explain in detail how you'll continue to acquire them.
