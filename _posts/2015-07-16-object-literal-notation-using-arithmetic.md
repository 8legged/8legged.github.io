excerpt: "Understanding object literal notation, using arithmetic. No libraries."

1. Consider a simple form of arithmetic expression consisting only of numbers,
additions, and multiplications. For instance:
5, 5 + 3, 3 * 2, 5 * (3 + 2), (4 + 1) * (3 + 2).

###### Example:
Write code to process a (set/string?) of equations.
Input would be 1 + 1, (1 + 1) * 2, (1 +1) + (2 - 1).

2. Define an OO model for the following:
A student at a university may be an **undergraduate**, **graduate**, or
**professional** student. An **undergraduate** may be a **freshman**,
**sophmore**, **junior**, or **senior**; they may also be **honors students**.
Any **undergraduate** may take **undergraduate courses**, but only **honors
students** may take **honors courses**. **Graduate** students may take
**graduate** and **undergraduate courses**, **professionals** may only take
**professional courses**, but a **student** may be both a **professional** and
**graduate student**.

3. Develop an OO model for an app that helps the user find locations of interest
along the route of a highway trip.
