> Guidelines
- Readability and discovery of posts/linkblogs should take priority.
- Category titles should explain how a reader's experience is improved.

# Readbility
- Implement a Style Guide [[resources](https://gist.github.com/8legged/98d69eee998eed6bb9ef)]

# Inspiration
- My linkblog could use a card style like [this](http://tympanus.net/codrops/collective/collective-178/).

# Organization
- Keep a list of insights like [this page does](http://fltdsgn.com/category/annual-report/).
