Where should I store my Jekyll data?

* **Collection** - As the most flexible option, this is usually the best choice. Unless you have one of the requirements below, this is probably what you'll want to use.

* **Data File** - If the data is already in a CSV, YML, JSON or you would usually store that information in one of those file formats, go with a Data File.

* **Front Matter** - If you need to order data in a non-sortable way and that data only needs to be used on a single page, use an array in Front Matter.
